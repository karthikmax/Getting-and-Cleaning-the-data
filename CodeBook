The run_analysis.R performs the following:

1. Data is merged using rbind() function. The merging is based on the number of the columns and features
2. Column names having mean or std are extracted and are assigned appropriate label names from features.txt
3. Activity names and IDs are taken from activity_labels.txt file and substituted in the above dataset
4. Column names are corrected
5. enerate a new dataset with the average measures of each subject and activity type and named averages_data.txt

Variables

1. x_train, x_test, y_train, y_text, subject_train and subject_test are the raw data
2. x_data, y_data and subject_data are merged data from above
3. features has the variable names for x_data and ftrs_mean_std has the variable names with either mean or std and used on x_data
4. activities variable has the activity types and it is applied on y_data
5. Using ddply() function, the averages are calculated and stored in averages_data.txt.
